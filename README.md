# loan-approval-prediction-using-ML
Loan approval prediction using machine learning involves training models on historical data to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on factors like credit score, income, and loan history. These models, such as decision trees or neural networks, help automate and improve the accuracy of the loan approval process.
